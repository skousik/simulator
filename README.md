# simulator

This is a set of tools for simulating a rigid body robot in MATLAB. The three key components for this simulator are:

1) Agent: the robot to be simulated. See agent.m for an overview.

2) Planner/s: the planning algorithm/s that are used to navigate the agent through a simulated environment. See planner.m for the overview.

3) World/s: the environment/s that the agent must navigate through. See world.m for an overview.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you should just need MATLAB. Please let Shreyas know if there are any issues :)

## Getting Started

Make sure the simulator repo and all subfolders are on your path, and you're ready to go!

A small and easy-to-understand example is available [here](https://github.com/ramvasudevan/RTD/blob/master/examples/online_trajectory_planning/segway/online_planning_example_1.m).
